For this equation, there are two types of behavior. For one set of parameter values, we have monostability, whereby all initial concentrations evolve to the same fixed-point value. For another set, we have three fixed points, and the initial concentration will determine which steady state is selected. Additionally,

As the slope Î³ is increased, the system traverses a region of multistability and returns to a state of monostability.
