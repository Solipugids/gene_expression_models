### Vector field in the phase plane

### Nullclines and unstable manifold

The unstable manifold can be drawn by the R package [*phaseR*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phaseR/index.html). The vector filed and nullclines can also be analysis by this package. I put both of the implementation in the seperated scirpts.
